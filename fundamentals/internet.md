# Internet

> The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

#### Basics

#### HTTP

> HTTP is the `TCP/IP` based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. HTTP follows a classical "Client-Server model" with a client opening a connection request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, that means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP))

#### Browsers

> A web browser is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical user interface.

#### Domain Name

> A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as `google.com`, and `facebook.com`. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the Domain Name System (DNS).

#### DNS

> The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

#### Hosting

> Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.
