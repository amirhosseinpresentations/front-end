# React Online Store

This is a simple online store project built with Vite. The project fetches product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) and implements basic authentication. The shopping cart data is stored in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Login Page**: Basic authentication for accessing the cart.
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of products fetched from the Fake Store API.
- **Product Page**: Shows detailed information about a specific product.
- **Cart Page**: Displays the list of items in the shopping cart.

## Design

The design should be similar to [Digikala](https://digikala.com), but in English! (because the API results are in English)

## Required Packages

For implementing this project, you should use these packages:

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building responsive web applications.
- **React Query**: A data-fetching library for React that provides hooks for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data.
- **Sass**: A CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins to CSS.
- **react-router-dom**: Navigate Between Pages
