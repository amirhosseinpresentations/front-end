# Yoga Positions App

## Project Overview

This project is a yoga positions application designed for a junior front-end developer to implement using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The application will display a list of yoga positions on the [home page](#home-page) and provide detailed information for each position on a separate [detail page](#detail-page). The project aims to provide a responsive, user-friendly interface that adheres to a given Figma design and includes a demo. Users can also add their favorite yoga poses to a list stored using the local storage API. The application will be a Progressive Web App ([PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)).
